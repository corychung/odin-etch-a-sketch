#The Odin Project: Etch-A-Sketch

This project is [live on Github Pages.](https://corychung.github.io/odin-etch-a-sketch)

This project was very fun and allowed me to play around more with CSS styling and DOM manipulation in JS. I enjoyed optimizing my code to make it the most efficient as well as the most readable and understandable and I also believe I did a solid job of making the UI look good and usable.
